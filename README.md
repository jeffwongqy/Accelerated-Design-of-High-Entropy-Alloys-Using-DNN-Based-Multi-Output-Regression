# Accelerated-Design-of-High-Entropy-Alloys-Using-DNN-Based-Multi-Output-Regression

This internship project is associated with the A*STAR ARIA Internship Project

This project aims to utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to concurrently predict critical mechanical propertiesâ€”yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation. This approach streamlines the materials design and optimization process by offering rapid and accurate insights into the mechanical behavior of new alloys and composites, ultimately expediting the development of high-performance materials.
